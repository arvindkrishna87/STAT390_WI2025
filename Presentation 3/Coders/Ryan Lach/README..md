### Normal Squares, toggleable features 
-   This code creates a series of squares around the perimeter of a cell, normal to its outline, that can then be extracted into images
-   second_pass and variable_length can be toggled for additional overlap accuracy and varying lenghts of squares, respectively
    - If using varying length, I reccomend using a slightly higher overlap threshold as it still provides serviceable results but can yield few to no squares otherwise
