Put whatever you did here, except data files. Don't put any data files (tissue images) here, they are too large for github. You may indicate the data your code uses - provide the OneDrive link to that data, or just mention the path to it.

If you wrote any code (python / QuPath / any other language), comment it well, and put it here, along with a Readme file describing the code. If the code is meant to be useful to other people, put instructions in the Readme file on how to use it. You will get extra credit if many people use your code!

If you did literature survey, then put it here as well.

I was assigned question 2 with William. We decided he would help explain it and I would provide an example. I found this interesting study ( https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9953929/ ) and used it to explain why different patch sizes might work that are not necessarily powers of 2. So, I made slides 21 and 22 and presented them.
