Week 4
Created Slide 5-6 through researched the four step process of UDI index, reviewed literature on the picturial difference between
UD objects versus normal objects, analyzed the formula of UDI in-depth on the meaning of each variable and how the mathematical equation for
UDI Knn works.
Tailored UDI to our project in proposing the different steps of how UDIs will be implemented in our case if decided to do so. Proposed several questions
on the specific implementation of UDI in our model.
Collaboratively reviewed whether UDI is suitable and efficient for our project.
Week 5
Followed up in revising the conclusion of UDI based on feedback and discussion. Researched deeper in the feature vector encode and selection process of
UDI, proposed several implementation question to consider, presented how vectors were created based on the characteristics of features in the photo.
