Building on the issues of last week which include the following: 
    1. epithelium width calculation needed to account of multiple epithelium locations 
    2. global orientation needed to be changed to local orientation 

We worked on figuring out how we can optimize the time cost of running our patching code but also 
figuring out how to best calculate epithelium width at multiple spots on the same x or y axis. We also figured 
out how to calculate orientation locally. 

Anna worked on how to calculate epithelium width at multiple points. 

I figured out how to calculate orientation locally by placing a small mask on the coordinates of the balanced points. 
The logic of the function that determines orientation remains largely untouched, but by running the function on this
small mask instead of the entire mask, we can determine orientation locally. 

By combining the two, we get an improved patching algorithm that also generalizes well to other tissue slices.
