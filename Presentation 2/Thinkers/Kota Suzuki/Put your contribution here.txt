I spent the last two weeks familiarizing myself with Alyssa's patching code to then
make necessary adjustments to fix one issues. The issue that came up with Alyssa's code was that it 
generalized really poorly to tissue slices with varying epithelium width. To fix this, we decided to alter her code to 
dynamically change the `initial_size` parameter of her patches depending on the epithelium width. 

To do this, I wrote three additional functions within Alyssa's code: 
`determine_orientation`, `calculate_epithelium_width`, and `compute_epithelium_widths`

`determine_orientation` takes the epithelium mask as an input and determines whether the orientation is vertical or horizontal.
Depending on the orientation of the slice, the way I calculate width slightly changes. 

`calculate_epithelium_width` takes the index of a row or column (depending on orientation), the epithelium mask itself, 
and the orientation. If the orientation of the slice is vertical, we are interested in calculating the width of 
horizontal slices. Since the mask consists of either zero or some nonzero number depending on the color of the pixels, 
the function loops over the the mask to caluclate the maximum number of consecutive nonzero numbers in the binary array, 
which represents the width of the epithelium in that slice. 

For example, let's say this is the binary mask: 

0 0 0 0 255
0 0 255 255 255

if we call the function as such: calculate_epithelium_width(row_or_col=1, mask=non_black_white_mask, orientation="vertical"),
the following happens: 
slice_mask = mask[0, :] -> [0, 0, 255, 255, 255]
binary_slice = [0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
max_width = 3 

`compute_epithelium_widths` exists entirely to iterate over all columns or rows of the mask to return the list of widths
in a Numpy array. **IMPORTANT**: I am still debating whether or not to use this. 

This helps me calculate the distribution of the widths which helps with the following: 

    all_widths = compute_epithelium_widths(non_black_white_mask, tissue_orientation)

    q1 = np.percentile(all_widths, 25)  
    q2 = np.percentile(all_widths, 50)  
    q3 = np.percentile(all_widths, 75)

If I decide that using quartiles rather than hard-coded thresholds is more optimal, I will actually use this function. 

At the moment, the code works like this: 

    if tissue_orientation == "horizontal":
        epithelium_width = calculate_epithelium_width(center_x, non_black_white_mask, tissue_orientation)
    else:
        epithelium_width = calculate_epithelium_width(center_y, non_black_white_mask, tissue_orientation)
    
    # Dynamically adjust initial_size based on the width's quantile
    if epithelium_width < 20:
        initial_size = max(1, round(0.1 * epithelium_width))
    elif epithelium_width < 30:
        initial_size = round(0.15 * epithelium_width)
    elif epithelium_width < 50:
        initial_size = round(0.2 * epithelium_width)
    else:
        initial_size = round(0.4 * epithelium_width)

This ensures that initial_size is dependent on the epithelium width. The values are entirely arbitrary at this point, so 
we definitely still need to tune these values to yield the best results. 

While this is definitely still a work in progress, we figured out a way to dynamically change the `initial_shape` parameter 
so that Alyssa's patching code can work with tissue slices that have varying width throughout the slice.
