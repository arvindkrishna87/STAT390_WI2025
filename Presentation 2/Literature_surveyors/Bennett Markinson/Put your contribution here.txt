Researched, analyzed, and presented 4 articles relating to the question Why is the patch shape taken as a square in tissue image analysis, machine learning?

Researched about uniform patch size and the current benefits for using square patches:

Slides info includesl
Square patches are typically used because uniform patch shapes helps computational efficiency and consistent feature extraction: [6]
Aligns with grid structure of images
Uniformity ensures that all patches contribute equally to the classification task
Important to avoid distortion or bias introduced by irregular shapes
Article uses example of laparoscopic surgeries
Uses square patching
Achieved 98.4% in tissue classification.

Additional info: Multispectral imaging for superior tissue differentiation compared to RGB imaging
article discusses a method for intraoperative tissue classification using multispectral image patches for computer-assisted laparoscopic surgeries

Researched about the use of rectangle patch size in similar medical problems and whether using non square patch sizing was effective:
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7848208

Slide info:
Study found that used rectangular patches in fundus images for detecting diabetic retinopathy [7]
Rectangular patches have been used instead of square patches before
Texture, color models, and stats measures extracted from 48x64 pixel rectangular patches 
High sensitivity and specificity for detecting hard exudates
Challenges in distinguishing hemorrhages due to minor color differences
In this study, it was more practical to use rectangular patches as it fit the image structure better

Additional info:
Features such as texture, color models, and statistical measures are extracted from 48Ã—64 pixel rectangular patches to classify normal, hemorrhage, and hard exudate regions.

Finally researched about an alternative AI called patchAI that automatically analyes a problem and decides which patch size would be optimal. Could be very helpful for our problem:

Slide info:
patchIT is a tool for creating image patches tailored for different image processing tasks  [8]
Customizable patch size, shape, and overlap to meet needs
Streamlines patch creation and effective feature extraction while being computationally efficient.
requires two parameters: the input image and the patch size
Used for object detection and medical imaging
We could use this for our problem to test if other patch sizes may be optimal for our data

Additional info:
They provide an alternative representation of the image as a set of partial local sub-images (patches) which is a vital preprocessing step in many image processing applications. In this paper a new software tool called patchIT is presented providing an integrated framework suitable for the systematic and automatized extraction of patches from images based on user defined geometrical and spatial criteria

patchIT is a tool designed for extracting image patches tailored to different image processing and analysis tasks. It allows users to customize the size, shape, and overlap of patches to suit various applications like object recognition and texture analysis. The tool integrates preprocessing features to normalize input images and optimize patch extraction. By creating patches systematically it makes sure the data is prepared efficient and is compatible with machine learning models, enhancing performance in applications such as medical imaging, object detection, and feature extraction.
