First, I asked about Eli's patching algorithm because I thought it could be helpful.

On the website, I wrote out the tilting of patches alogrithms. This included a little bit about how Aryaman apporached tilting patches, 
and the regression idea posed by Krish. I went through the pros and cons of each.

When we presented Monday, we got many notes. After splitting up tasks, Olivia and I tag-teamed the automation page of the website. 
I wrote the general overview of automation. I delved into Kyla's code -- its challenges and efficiencies. I posted on ED to see 
what issues people were having. I also updated the epithelium detection section and made sure it reflected some of the issues that 
happened with it last quarter. I also deleted the link to their API as it is not relevant to doctors right now. I added 
some suggestions for improving the model. Finally, I wrote the conclusion of that page. 

For workflow, I came up with the idea of the contact sheet and made that sheet in the teams spreadsheet.
