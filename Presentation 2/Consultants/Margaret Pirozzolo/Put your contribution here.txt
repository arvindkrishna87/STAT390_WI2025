First, I asked about Eli's patching algorithm. 
On the website, I wrote out the tilting of patches alogrithms. This included a little bit about how Aryaman apporached tiltin patches, and the regression idea posed by Krish. I went through the pros and cons of each.

When we presented Monday, we got many notes. After splitting up tasks, Olivia and I tag-teamed the automation page of the website. I wrote the general overview of automation. I delved into Kyla's code -- its challenges and efficiencies. I posted on ED to see what issues people were having. I also updated the epithelium detection section and made sure it reflected the issues that happened with it last quarter. Finally, I wrote the conclusion of that page.
