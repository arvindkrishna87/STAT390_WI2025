For Monday's progress report, I primarily worked on helping to brainstorm pros/cons for Alyssa's and Aryaman's code (multiple of us helped with this), and I also added/started the actual pros/cons tables for Alyssa's, Aryaman's, and Eli's code on the "Patching" section of the website. Additionally, I updated the "About page" so as to include information about our current quarter rather than the fall. 

For Wednesday, I worked with Margaret on writing up the "Automation" page of the website, in which we detailed our current automation procedures and how we aim on improving them in the future. Specifically, I covered Cara's method for slice extraction, briefly referring to its logic by referring to the more detailed explanation described in "Step 1" before going into specific areas of improvement based on our class' experience doing Presentation 1 (edits will likely continue to be made here as more people reply to Margaret's Ed discussion post). I also added the whole section detailing our current automation methodology for tissue matching. I also did a final pass on the page after we both wrote up all our information and adjusted for any clarity/formatting issues. 

I also made some very minor adjustments to the "About" page after the suggestions we received on Monday.
