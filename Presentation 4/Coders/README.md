# Presentation 3 - Coders

## Objectives 

1. Ryan, Nathan - update notebook with any other ideas to improve patching
2. Sharon, Hannah - debugging

    i. Some patches don't cover the entire epithelium width - Sharon

   ii. If the epithelium is disjoint (>1 contour found) then patches are only taken from 1 contour - Hannah

3. Sari - testing on at least 5 problematic H&E images

Your task will be complete if you claim that your code has no bugs! Of course, if you come across more bugs that are difficult to resolve, we can continue with those next week. However, until you can claim that your code is perfect, keep working on this simplified objective.

At any point of time, if you think your code is perfect, send the results of your patching algo on 5-6 slices, and the code to Krish."							

## Instructions

Please read Ryan's code first, as all other members of our team made modifications to his code to debug/fix different issues that came up in his code. Afterwards, feel free to look at any member's code, as each of our contributions do not overlap with each other (note that Sari's code is used across all notebooks to test all modifications). Because each one of us is working on different parts of the same code simultaneously, all notebooks should run independently from one another.
