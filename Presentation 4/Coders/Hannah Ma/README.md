This week I worked on debugging a contour selection function from Ryan's `Normal_Squares_Toggleable` notebook.

A full description of my objective, approach, and code changes this week can be found in `Normal_Squares_Toggleable_hannah.ipynb`

Supporting images, tissues slices used for testing, etc. can be found in the `/data` subdirectory.
