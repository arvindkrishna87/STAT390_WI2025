This week I worked on debugging the contour selection function from my work last week (see `Presentation 3/Coders/Hannah Ma/Normal_Squares_Toggleable_hannah.ipynb`).

A full description of my objective, approach, and code changes this week can be found in `Normal_Squares_Toggleable_hannah_wk4.ipynb`

Supporting images, tissues slices used for testing, etc. can be found in the `/data` subdirectory.
