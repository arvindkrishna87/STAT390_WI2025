This week, I was tasked with looking at different more rare cases of C-MIL that involve inflammation of the cells. I looked at reserach to determine what defines inflammation, how is it identified clinically, and then how to properly identify it in our stains. I also attempted to analyze wheter inflammation can potentially lead to a low grade or high grade classification but unfortunately could not find much research related to that specific point. 

Throughout this week, I also watched the previous stakeholder meetings where Dr. Yamini Krishna discussed inflammation in C-MIL in specific cases to help me understand how to identify it properly. The main findings I found is that inflammation can appear as dark and red in the stroma and that it slowly eats at the epithelium. In the slide show, I showcases a couple examples from those video.

The other interesting thing I found while researching inflammation is inflamed juvenile conjunctival nevu. This is a benign inflammatory condition in a region of the conjuctiva and is mostly present in children as well as adolescents. But what is interesting is that even though it is benign, it has takeaways for what to look for within C-MIL to help identify inflammation.



HERE IS A LINK TO MY NOTES DOC FOR THE WEEK with more information regarding all of these topics about inflammation:

If you did literature survey, then put it here as well.
