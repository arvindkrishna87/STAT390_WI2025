This directory contains the most recent developments from the coding team. No inherent order amongst notebooks as different team members work on different objectives. The name of the team member responsible for each notebook is at the end of the main body of the file name, which describes the algorithm or approach coded within the notebook.

These algorithms are as follows:
`Contour_Normal_Gridding` - Patching algorithm developed by Ryan that utilizes the contours of cells to take - focus of Week 2
`Normal_Squares_Toggleable` - Improved version of `Contour_Normal_Gridding` - focus of Week 3
