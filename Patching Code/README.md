This directory contains code that is being actively worked on by the coding team. No inherent order exists amongst notebooks as different team members work on improving different aspects of one main algorithm each week. The name of the team member responsible for each notebook is at the end of the main body of the file name, which describes the algorithm or approach coded within the notebook.

These algorithms are as follows:
* `Contour_Normal_Gridding` - Patching algorithm developed by Ryan that utilizes the contours of cells to take - focus of Week 2
* `Normal_Squares_Toggleable` - Improved version of `Contour_Normal_Gridding` - focus of Week 3


### Subdirectories:
* `/Segmenting code`: GeoJSON files of annotated slice masks, one idea to use for patching
* `/testing_slices`: pre-extracted epithelium slices to test patching algorithms on
